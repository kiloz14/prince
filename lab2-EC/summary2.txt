In my dashboard, I have used three charts to represent 5 different statistics from the cars. Those statistics are engine displacement vs horsepower, MPG of cars from different origins and Cylinders vs Weights in Cars. The reason why I chose those statistics is because is sensible to chart these relationships and compare it side by side. Also, it is color coded so that it is easier to determine which categories the charts lie in. 

One could gather from the charts that US cars are lower in MPG but high in Horsepower and Cylinders. This could be due to the fact that cars made in the US sacrifice good, efficient cars for more powerful, faster cars. This analysis is contributed by the Oil Embargo Act in the 1970-1980s which increases the demand for more fuel efficient cars, that are, coincidentally, made by foreign manufacturers. Furthermore, the engines in US cars are extremely bigger and more powerful than European and Japanese cars, which leads into the circular chart that US cars have a higher maximum of weight than other cars from different regions.
